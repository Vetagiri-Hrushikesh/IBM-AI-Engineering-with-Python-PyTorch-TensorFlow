## Data Scientist vs AI Engineer (Generative AI Engineer) – Notes for Beginners

### What You Will Learn

By the end, you’ll be able to:

- Understand what data scientists and AI engineers do.
- See why generative AI is changing the tech world.
- List the main differences in their work: use cases, data, models, and project processes.
- Know some tools and terms like “foundation models” and “prompt engineering.”

### 1. Introduction: The Changing Roles

- Data Science was called the “sexiest job of the 21st century.”
- Now, **AI Engineering** (especially with generative AI) is a hot new role!
- Generative AI is so new and powerful, it has become a separate field called “AI Engineering.”

### 2. Use Case Differences

- **Data Scientist:** *Data storyteller*
  - Uses lots of messy data to find insights about the past.
  - Main tool: **Descriptive analytics** (understanding what happened).
  - Example activity: **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – making graphs, looking for trends.
  - Groups similar items (**Clustering**) – like segmenting shoppers by their habits.
  - Predicts outcomes with **machine learning**:
    - **Regression** – predicts numbers (e.g., revenue, temperature).
    - **Classification** – predicts categories (e.g., success/failure, spam/not spam).

- **AI Engineer (Generative):** *AI system builder*
  - Uses foundation models to make powerful business tools and apps.
  - Focuses on:
    - **Prescriptive analytics** – choosing the best action, e.g. decision optimization to find the best solutions.
    - **Recommendation engines** – suggesting products or marketing strategies.
    - **Generative AI tasks** – builds chatbots, coding assistants, digital advisors, which can create new content (like text or images).

### 3. The Data They Use

- **Data Scientist:**
  - Likes **structured/tabular data** (tables with rows and columns).
  - Works mostly with hundreds to hundreds of thousands of rows.
  - Spends time cleaning the data: removing outliers, joining tables, making new features.

- **AI Engineer (Generative):**
  - Works with **unstructured data** (text, images, video, audio).
  - Example: Large Language Models (LLMs) need billions or trillions of words (tokens).
  - Handles data on much larger scale than traditional data science.

### 4. The Models They Build

- **Data Scientist:**
  - Has hundreds of model types (regression, classification, clustering, etc.).
  - Each model is trained for specific problem and dataset.
  - Models are *narrow* in scope, small in size, need less computing power, and train quickly (seconds to hours).

- **AI Engineer (Generative):**
  - Mostly works with **foundation models** (like GPT, DALL·E, etc.).
  - One model can do many things—very *wide* scope.
  - Huge size (billions of parameters), needs lots of compute (many GPUs), trains for weeks to months.

### 5. How Their Projects Run

- **Data Scientist:**
  - Process: Choose use case → Collect/clean data → Train/validate models (feature engineering, cross validation) → Deploy model to predict in real time.

- **AI Engineer (Generative):**
  - Process: Start with use case → Use pre-trained foundation model (no need for scratch training).
  - Thanks to **AI democratization**, anyone can access these powerful models in open communities (like Hugging Face).
  - AI engineers use **prompt engineering** (writing instructions or prompts) in natural language to get the model to do different things.
  - Use various frameworks (like chaining prompts, PEFT for fine-tuning, RAG for better search and grounding, creating autonomous agents).
  - Final step is embedding the AI model in apps, assistants, websites, or automations.

### 6. Overlaps and Evolution

- There is still overlap! Data scientists can work on prescriptive analytics, and AI engineers sometimes work with structured data.
- Both fields are growing fast, with new tools, models, and research arriving all the time.

***

### 7. Summary

- **Data Scientists** focus on exploring and interpreting structured data, building models for specific tasks and predictions.
- **AI Engineers** (especially in generative AI) use powerful, flexible models with lots of unstructured data to create apps, assistants, and automations by leveraging prompt engineering and foundation models.
- Generative AI is changing what’s possible, opening new jobs and opportunities.
