## Video Script: Data Scientist vs AI Engineer (Generative AI Engineer)

***

**[Intro]**

Hey there!  
In the last few years, you might have heard that data science is the “sexiest job of the 21st century.” But now, there’s a fresh contender for that title—the AI engineer, especially those building generative AI systems.  
So, what’s the difference? Are these just two names for the same career, or are AI engineers doing something totally new?  
Let’s find out by exploring the four main areas where data scientists and generative AI engineers work differently.

**[Section 1: What You Will Learn]**

Today, you’ll learn:

- Who data scientists and AI engineers are.
- How generative AI is changing the tech landscape.
- The main differences in their use cases, data, models, and ways of working.
- What terms like “foundation models” and “prompt engineering” mean.

**[Section 2: Changing Roles in Data and AI]**

For years, data scientists were the hottest job in tech.  
But with the rise of generative AI, AI engineering is suddenly in the spotlight!  
Generative AI is so powerful and versatile that it has created a new, fast-growing field called AI engineering.

**[Section 3: How Their Use Cases Differ]**

Think of a **data scientist** as a storyteller—someone who takes huge, messy datasets and turns them into useful insights.

- Their work revolves around descriptive analytics: What happened in the past?
- Example: Drawing graphs, exploring trends (Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA).
- They also do clustering—grouping similar data points, like shoppers with similar habits.
- For predictions, they use machine learning:
  - **Regression** – predicting numbers like temperatures or revenue.
  - **Classification** – sorting things into categories, like success/failure.

Now, **AI engineers**, especially those working on generative AI, act more like system builders.

- Their work focuses on creating new business tools and smart solutions.
- They work on prescriptive analytics—choosing the best possible action.
  - Example: Decision optimization—finding the best way for a business to reach goals.
- Recommendation engines—personalized suggestions for shoppers or targeted marketing.
- They build generative systems—like smart chatbots, digital assistants, or coding tools that create something new (text, images, answers).

**[Section 4: The Data They Use]**

**Data Scientists:**

- Mostly use structured (tabular) data—think spreadsheets or databases.
- Datasets range from hundreds to thousands of examples.
- They spend lots of time cleaning the data—removing errors, joining tables, and making new features.

**AI Engineers (Generative):**

- Mostly work with unstructured data—like text, images, videos, audio files.
- Example: Training a large language model (LLM) takes billions or trillions of words!
- They handle data on a much larger scale than traditional data scientists.

**[Section 5: The Models They Build]**

**Data Scientists:**

- Use a whole toolbox filled with different models (regression, classification, clustering, etc.).
- Every dataset usually needs a specialized model trained just for that task.
- Their models are narrow in scope, smaller, need less computing, and train quickly.

**AI Engineers (Generative):**

- Mostly use powerful “foundation models” (like GPT or DALL·E)—one model can tackle many different tasks.
- These models are huge (billions of settings), need massive computers (lots of GPUs), and can take weeks or months to train.
- One foundation model can be used for multiple jobs without retraining from scratch.

**[Section 6: How Their Projects Work]**

**Data Scientist’s process:**

- Start with a use case → collect and clean data → build and validate models → deploy model for real-time predictions.

**Generative AI Engineer’s process:**

- Start with a use case → grab a pre-trained foundation model (no need to build one from scratch).
- Thanks to AI democratization, these powerful models are open and available to anyone (think Hugging Face).
- Use prompt engineering—writing natural language instructions or questions to guide the model.
- Can chain prompts, fine-tune models for special tasks, build search systems using RAG, or create autonomous agents for complex tasks.
- Embed finished models into apps, assistants, websites, or automated workflows.

***

**[Section 7: Overlap and Evolution]**

Remember: The differences aren’t absolute!  
- Data scientists can work on prescriptive analytics.
- AI engineers may use structured data.
Both fields are advancing rapidly. New tools, models, and techniques are emerging every day.

**[Conclusion]**

Let’s recap:

- **Data Scientists** turn raw data into insights, build models for specific tasks, and mostly work with structured data.
- **AI Engineers (Generative)** use huge, flexible foundation models with unstructured data to build chatbots, assistants, and smart applications powered by prompt engineering.
- Generative AI is revolutionizing what’s possible in tech—opening up new jobs, new ways to work, and new opportunities.

With data, AI, and a creative mind, the possibilities really are endless.
